# DMP Frontend Testing Project

## Objective:
Your task is to create a responsive web page based on the design provided in Figma: [Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/TumeHzNdMGPfl9r1ImHLSv/dmpagency-frontend-technical-task?node-id=0-1&t=cMwsNzPqd3PaHLzG-1).

## Requirements:

### HTML and CSS:
1. **Structure**:
   The page must follow the structure outlined in the design.
3. **CSS Rules**:
   - Follow a **mobile-first approach**.
   - Avoid "magic constants" (always use variables or appropriate units, such as `em` or `rem`).
   - Each component should be self-contained and independent of its parent.
   - Use css variables
---

### Responsiveness:
The page must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

---

### Technologies:
- **Figma** (for reading and referencing the design).

---

### Nice to have
- **BEM Methodology**: Use the BEM naming convention for classes. Refer to [BEM Guide](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/prirucka/bem).

## Submission:
Upon completion, package your output into a `.zip` file and send it via email, or upload it to your own **Github repository** and provide us with the link.
